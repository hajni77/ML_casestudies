Feature Extraction

    Feature extraction is a process used in machine learning to reduce the number of resources needed for processing without losing important or relevant information. Feature extraction helps in the reduction of the dimensionality of data which is needed to process the data effectively. In other words, feature extraction involves creating new features that still capture the essential information from the original data but in a more efficient way.

    Algorithms often perform better with a reduced number of features. This is because noise and irrelevant details are removed, allowing the algorithm to focus on the most important aspects of the data.

    With too many features, models can become overfitted to the training data, meaning they may not generalize well to new, unseen data. Feature extraction helps to prevent this by simplifying the model.

Methods of Feature Extraction
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
        PCA is a statistical method that transforms the data into a new coordinate system, where the greatest variance by some projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.

    Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): 
        LDA is used to find the linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes of objects or events.

    Autoencoders:
        Autoencoders are a type of neural network that is trained to attempt to copy its input to its output. During training, the network learns to represent the input as a compressed form, which can be used as features for another task.

    t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):
        t-SNE is a non-linear technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three dimensions, which can then be visualized in a scatter plot.

    Independent Component Analysis (ICA): 
        ICA is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents that are maximally independent.
    
    Feature Agglomeration: 
        This method involves merging similar features together to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
